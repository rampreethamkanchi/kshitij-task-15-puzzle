## 15 Puzzle Game

### Overview
The 15 Puzzle Game is a classic sliding puzzle implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can experience it live at [this link](https://rampreethamkanchi.github.io/kshitij-task-15-puzzle/). The game challenges players to arrange numbered tiles in ascending order within a grid.

### Features

- **Timer and Move Counter**: Keep track of your time and moves to enhance your puzzle-solving skills.
- **Pause and Play Functionality**: Pause and resume the game at your convenience.
- **Mirror Puzzle**: Use the "Mirror" feature for an additional challenge by viewing a mirrored version of the current puzzle state.
